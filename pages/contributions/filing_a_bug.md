## Separate out the bug

The first step in in writing an effective bug report is to find exactly:

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
- **What is the problem?**
  
  Clearly and precisely state what exactly is wrong?

- **How to reproduce it?**

    - If you have an explicit understanding about what exactly is wrong, you can reproduce an example of the problem        	
    - If you can answer both the questions and reliably reproduce an example of the problem, you are successful in distinctly separating out the bug.

## Check whether bug already stands reported

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
Since Sunbird is open source, there is always a possibility that you encounter more than one bug, Incase, if you have multiple issues, it is better to file them separately, so that they can be tracked more effectively

## Writing an effective bug report

Before you raise an issue, make sure to check the following questions that are used for filing a bug report, answers to these allows you to file an efficient and clear in the process of filing bug reports.

### Issue Title
Everything starts with a title. It must be clear and descriptive so that you can get an idea of what the report is about at a glance. It also has to be clearly differentiated from all other existing bug reports. A good way to think about bug titles is that your bug report should atleast answer the following questions:

  1. What is the problem?

  2. What action must the user perform to trigger the problem?

  3. Where does the problem occur?

And keep in mind, answer to these questions must be in less than 140 characters!

The title should describe the problem as best as possible. Remember that the title is read more often than any other part of the bug report.

After submitting the issue, you can modify the title.

### A concise issue description

A good bug report has a clear and concise description. This is an opportunity to explain the defect and put across all the relevant details.Describing something accurately and concisely is best way to help and fix the bug. Also,remember that the person reading your description has not seen the bug, so avoid assumptions.
=======
The bug you have experienced might already have a fix and you can check the related documentation. If not, it is recommended to check the Sunbird [issue tracker](https://github.com/project-sunbird/project-sunbird.github.io/issues)

- Check, If the bug report exists, you may click "subscribe" to follow any developments.
- If your bug is different than any others recorded in the issue tracker, then proceed with "Create a new issue"

## Single issue for a single bug

- Since Sunbird is open source, there is always a possibility that you encounter more than one bug, Incase, if you have multiple issues, it is better to file them separately, so that they can be tracked more effectively

## Create a new issue

<<<<<<< HEAD
One of the most important steps in a good bug report is providing a step-by-step account of exactly what you did to find the defect. You can use software tools that catch your key strokes, or record screenshots or video files as you test. Other times you will be writing from memory, so take notes as you go. Make sure that you test your own steps again before submitting the bug.

Ensure the following:
- A bug report needs clear instructions, so that others can understand and exclusively reproduce it
- Include good set of instructions i.e. a numbered list that details each button press, or menu selection

=======
### Sunbird Version
>>>>>>> parent of 6b765391... Update filing_a_bug.md

### Issue Category

A "bug report" is usually for when Sunbird does something which is not what it is expected to. An example of a bug could be: a link to a page, instead of opening it shows an error.

Tasks, feature requests and support requests are beyond the scope of this article.

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
#### Type and severity

Every bug will have a different type and severity. These fields go hand-in-hand. A functional bug will be treated more seriously than a suggestion. No product ships with zero defects, so having bugs categorized correctly in terms of type and severity helps the decision-making process with regards to what gets fixed and what does not. If you do not understand these fields, ask for instruction. It also helps to review other bug entries the issue tracker.

You can use the following tags in your bug reports:
=======
### Issue Priority
