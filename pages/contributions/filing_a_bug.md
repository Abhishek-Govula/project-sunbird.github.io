## Overview

This document describes how to file an effective Sunbird bug report. Before filing a bug report, check the troubleshooting page [here](http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/troubleshooting/) for a solution. If there exists no solution to your issue, the following process will guide you in figuring out and resolving your issue.

## Introduction
To report a bug in the Sunbird bug trackers, you need to create a tracker item. Add a tracker item. Once added, the Sunbird Developer team will check the validity of the issue raised and act accordingly.
### Prerequisites

- An Account on GIT, since the Sunbird repository lives in GitHub.
  - If you already have a GIT account, login with your credentials
  - If you do not have a GIT account, register for an account at GitHub [here](https://github.com/) 
  - The Sunbird Issue Tracker uses GitHub accounts for authentication
- Use the latest version of Sunbird
  - If you are using an out-of-date version of Sunbird, please update to the latest version.

After Prerequisites, follow these guidelines to ensure that your Bug report is clear and effective:

### Separate out the bug

The first step in in writing an effective bug report is to find exactly:
**What the problem is?**
Clearly and precisely state what exactly is wrong? 
•	How to reproduce it?
If you have an explicit understanding about what exactly is wrong, you can reproduce an example of the problem	
If you can answer both the questions and reliably reproduce an example of the problem, you are successful in distinctly separating out the bug.
Check whether bug already stands reported
The bug you have experienced might already have a fix and you can check the related documentation. If not, it is a recommended to check the Sunbird issue tracker. 
•	Check, If the bug report exists, you may click "subscribe" to follow any developments. 
•	If your bug is different than any others recorded in the issue tracker, then proceed with "Create a new issue".
Single issue for a single bug 
The Sunbird is open source, and there is always a possibility that you encounter more than one bug, Incase, if you have multiple issues, it is better to file them separately, so that they can be tracked more effectively.
Create a new issue
You can create a new issue as follows:
•	Visit the official Sunbird website [here](www.sunbird.org) 
•	Navigate to [documentation] (http://www.sunbird.org/docs/) section found on horizontal top menu of the website.
•	Click on any of the tiles (Architecture, Developer docs etc.) on the page
•	Click [Report issue] (https://github.com/project-sunbird/project-sunbird.github.io/issues) (a link found on the right side of every page). 
•	Click on "Create a new issue ".
•	Before you raise an issue, make sure to check the following questions that are used for filing a bug report, answers to these allows you to file an efficient and clear in the process of filing bug reports.
When filing a new bug, it is compulsory to include:
•	Descriptive title: use clear keywords so others can find and understand your bug
•	Reproduce the problem: repeat and record/write the exact steps to trigger the problem that you encountered in description clearly.
•	Provide the location:
•	Actual Behavior: What happens when you follow the steps? 
•	Expected Behavior: what you expected to happen instead?
•	Exact Text/Screenshots: Include the exact text of any error messages if applicable (or upload screenshots).
•	Application Version: Sunbird version (or if you are pulling directly from Git, your current commit SHA - use git rev-parse HEAD)
•	Precheck: Did this work in an earlier version? If so, also give the version that it worked in.
•	Operating System & version: Mention the Operating system version and make
