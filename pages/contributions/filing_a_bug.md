## Overview

Writing a good bug report is not hard. Just follow a few effective techniques and you will be writing super bug reports in no time at all. 

Please keep in mind that there are a few alternative options for support:

1. Check the [sunbird troubleshooting](http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/troubleshooting/) page for a solution. If there is no solution for your issue, the following process will guide you in figuring out what to do.
2. The bug you have experienced might be faced by others also, it is recommended to check the [Sunbird issue tracker](https://github.com/project-sunbird/project-sunbird.github.io/issues)
3. If the bug report exists, you may click "subscribe" to follow any developments.


## Separate out the bug
The first step in in writing an effective bug report is to find exactly:

- **What is the problem?**
  
  Clearly and precisely state what exactly is wrong?

- **How to reproduce it?**

    - If you have an explicit understanding about what exactly is wrong, you can reproduce an example of the problem        	
    - If you can answer both the questions and reliably reproduce an example of the problem, you are successful in distinctly separating out the bug.

## Single issue for a single bug

Since Sunbird is open source, there is always a possibility that you encounter more than one bug, Incase, if you have multiple issues, it is better to file them separately, so that they can be tracked more effectively

## Writing an effective bug report

Before you raise an issue, make sure to check the following questions that are used for filing a bug report, answers to these allows you to file an efficient and clear in the process of filing bug reports.

### Issue Title
The title should describe the problem as best as possible. Remember that the title read more often than any other part of the bug report.

After submitting the issue, you can modify the title.

### Issue Description

#### Sequence of Steps to reproduce bug

- A bug report needs clear instructions, so that others can understand and exclusively reproduce it
- Include good set of instructions i.e a numbered list that details each button press, or menu selection

#### Actual behavior

- In contrast to the expected behavior, describe what currently happens when the bug is present.

#### Expected behavior

- Describe what actually is correct workflow or exactly should happen if the bug was fixed.

#### Environment in which the Issue Encountered

- Name the operating system and version you are using, such as "Windows 7", or "Mac OS X 10.7.5" etc.
- Name the browser and version which you are using, such as "Chrome 63" or "Firefox Quantum" or "Microsoft Edge"

#### Supporting Files

- If you can supplement your bug report with an image, audio, or crash log that helps others reproduce the issue, attach these files.

#### Sunbird Version
The version of Sunbird in which you discovered the bug (e.g., 1.3). If you can reproduce the problem in more than one version, write down the earliest.

#### Issue Category
A "bug report" is usually for when Sunbird does something which is not what it is expected to. An example of a bug could be: a link to a page, instead of opening it shows an error.

Tasks, feature requests and support requests are beyond the scope of this article.

#### Issue Severity

Every bug will have a different severity.

**Use "Critical" in case:**

- Encounter Data loss
- Data Corruption
- Inability to save work
- Hangs and crashes

**Use "Major" in case:**

- A Common feature is incorrectly/not functioning
- Otherwise critical issues, if they happen only in some very rare cases.
- All other bugs excluding the specified ones are as **normal** if the priority is not set.

**Note:** While a bug that you are experiencing is important to you, developers balance it with all the other known bugs.

### Submit

Click **Submit button** to submit your bug report to the issue tracker.

## Following up

Once a developer marks a bug as fixed, it is a good idea to ensure that it is completely fixed. To test, download the latest build.
