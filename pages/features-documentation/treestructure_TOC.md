The tree structure of the Table of Contents in the creation module  is composed of a hierarchical system of nodes. There are three types of nodes: <br>&emsp;a) <b>Parent Node</b>: The default node in the ToC pane representing the entire compilation of nodes <br>&emsp;b) <b>Child Node</b>: Sub-node of a given node <br>&emsp;c) <b>Sibling Node</b>: Nodes on the same hierarchical level under the same parent node
For example, you are creating a textbook on vocabulary. The entire textbook is the parent node, the first default level in the ToC. There are ten units in this textbook. Each of these unit are sub-nodes within the parent node. Create the first unit by adding a child node.  Since units are of the same hierarchical level, add consecutive units as sibling nodes.
You can add a child node within a sibling node. Each unit has tree chapters. Add the first chapter a as child nodes within each respective child nodes (i.e., units). Add the remaining chapters as sibling nodes within the child node, since the three chapters are the same hierarchy level.
You can further have activities within each of these chapters. Browse and add resources (activities) within each chapter.

### Adding Child Node

To add a child node, you can either:
a.	Click New Child from the burger menu associated with the required node in the left navigation pane, OR
b.	Right-click on the node name and select New Child, OR
c.	Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+N
Metadata for Child Node: (H4)
On clicking New Child from the burger menu, the metadata for the child node is displayed on the right 
1. Enter Content Title 
2. Enter Description about the collection 
3. Enter Keywords 
4. Click Save to save the metadata of the collection 
5. Click Image icon to add image to the collection metadata. For details on adding image, refer Adding Image to Collection Metadata (This will be hyperlinked in the md page)
Adding Sibling Node: (H4)
To add a child node, you can either:
d.	Click New Sibling from the burger menu associated with the required node in the left navigation pane, OR
e.	Right-click on the node name and select New Sibling, OR
f.	Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N
Note: The metadata for Sibling Node is same as the Child Node. For details on the metadata, refer Metadata for Child Note (Hyperlink)
