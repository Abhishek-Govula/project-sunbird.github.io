## Overview
Badging is a mechanism commonly used to recognize people with a set of skills and accomplishments. Badges can represent an award, a certificate, an endorsement or an authorization.
Organizations can assign badges to users for:
• Completing prescribed courses on DIKSHA
• Using DIKSHA in classrooms for prescribed or more duration of time
• Creating content on DIKSHA which has increased consumption rate
• Replicating awards and certifications received offline
This documentation details the procedure on how to assign badges to users. Currently, the process of assigning badges is a technical process using API references.
