## Concept:1

1. The image contains steps/instruction along with the display. The image frame is taken in the ratio of 16:9 (an ideal size of the frame for rectangular images). 

2. Image Scale: 

- **Horizontal spread** 20% on the either side (left & right) of the image is left for writing/viewing instructions (Total measurment= 20%+20% - instructions and 60% image area)
- **Vertical spread** 15% on the either side (top & bottom) of the image is left for writing Title/Caption and Notes respectively

3. The image is saved in the .svg format and zoom feature is enabled
