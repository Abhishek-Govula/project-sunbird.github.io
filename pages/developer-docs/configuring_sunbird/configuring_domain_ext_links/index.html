### Configuring the Domain
You can set the whitelisted domain in the environment variables of Sunbird to variable 'sunbird_extcont_whitelisted_domains'
Example: sunbird_extcont_whitelisted_domains='youtube.com,youtu.be,dailymotion.com', where youtube.com and youtu.be are default whitelisted domains, and dailymotion.com is the newly whitelisted domain.
