The goal of the configuration section is to provide a simple, but flexible, way for anyone to get an instance of Sunbird up and running that is fully configured and ready-to-go.

Before getting started, please look at the Sunbird [Installation options](pages\developer-docs\installation),  to see which method for deploying Sunbird is right for you.

Refer to the Installation pages, for detailed installation instructions
