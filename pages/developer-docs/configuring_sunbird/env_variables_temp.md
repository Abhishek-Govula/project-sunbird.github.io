On installation,  users can explore and work with Sunbird.  The installation process takes care of the default minimum configuration required to run Sunbird. However, if you want to customize your instance of Sunbird, it is simple. For example, you can change the default logo to the logo of your choice, or  change the default email address to your preferred email address.

Modify default behaviour, look and feel by overriding the default values of environment variables as mentioned in the following tables.

**Note:** If you have not installed Sunbird, refer to [Server Installation](\pages\developer-docs\installation\server_installation)



The detailed information about environment variables will be available soon..
