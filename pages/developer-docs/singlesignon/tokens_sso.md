Token is aone of the basic component of any surce code. Tokens are used to describe the characters in a code. For single sign process in Sunbird, JSON (JWT) web token is used. JWT (pronounced "jot") is used in the protocol to generate signed tokens which can be verified by the Receiving Party (RP). A JWT is a signed token containing claims from the sender to the recipient. Because the token is signed by the sender, the recipient can be sure that the token has not been tampered. For a more detailed overview of JWTs see: [https://jwt.io/introduction/](https://jwt.io/introduction/)
