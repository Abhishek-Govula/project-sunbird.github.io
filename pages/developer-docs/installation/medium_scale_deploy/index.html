<p>This page provides a summarized listing of the essential steps for planning, installing, and configuring your Sunbird deployment in a live environment. </p>

<h3 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>Before you install Sunbird into the production environment, examine your  environment and gather data to ensure an optimal installation experience.</p>

<p>Review the following to determine that the environment has the necessary resources and compliant target systems to successfully install and run Sunbird.</p>

<h4 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h4>

<p>To install Sunbird, the servers should have the following minimum system requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</li>
  <li>RAM: 7GB</li>
  <li>CPU: 2 cores, &gt;2 GHz</li>
  <li>root access (should be able to sudo)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="api-keys">API Keys</h4>

<p>API keys are supposed to approve a user or a device with authorization for access.For getting the API keys , you need to send an Email to :<a href="mailto:info@sunbird.org">info@sunbird.org</a>.</p>

<h4 id="ssl-certificate">SSL Certificate</h4>
<p>SSL Certificates are used to encrypt communication between a browser and the server. You will need an SSL certificate from a recognised CA. <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> provides free SSL certificates. You can also use a CA of your choice.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A self-signed certification will cause authentication to fail with an “Access Denied” error because the certificate will not be verified.</p>

<h4 id="relevant-variables">Relevant Variables</h4>

<p>To make the deployment scenario simple and clear, we use the following variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>implementation-name</strong> : This variable refers to the name of sunbird implementation. For example; Sunbird-Demo</li>
  <li><strong>environment-name</strong> : This variable refers to the name of the environment where you deploy Sunbird. For example; Development, Test, Staging, Production, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation-checklist">Installation Checklist</h3>

<p>Before you start the installation process make sure you have successfully</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review and check whether the system requirements are met.</li>
  <li>Check whether or not you  have the API keys.</li>
  <li>Decide the installation owner and the installation directory</li>
  <li>Gather information about the database, if you are installing the database server while installing Sunbird</li>
  <li>Set up or verify the product licensing requirements for the live environment</li>
  <li>Verify the required network requirements and that ports are available for Sunbird components to communicate</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="provisioning-servers">Provisioning servers</h3>

<p>Server provisioning is a set of actions to prepare a server with appropriate systems, data and software, and make it ready for network operation. Refer the link <a href="developer-docs/installation/provisioning_servers" target="_blank">Provisioning Servers</a>to see Automated and Manual process to provision the servers.</p>
