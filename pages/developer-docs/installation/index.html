<h3 id="size-and-verify-your-environment">Size and Verify Your Environment</h3>

<p>Requirements for Sunbird installation depend on the environment on which you install Sunbird and how you use Sunbird. 
For details, check the <strong>Prerequisites</strong> section for your chosen installation method. For example; if you choose to do a medium scale deployment of Sunbird, check <a href="http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/installation/medium_scale_deploy/#pre-requisites" target="_blank">here</a></p>

<h3 id="choosing-an-installation-method">Choosing an Installation method</h3>

<h3 id="try-sunbird">Try Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test its feature set, we recommend you use the <a href="https://staging.open-sunbird.org/" target="_blank">Sunbird sandbox</a> which is running in the cloud.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Data created in the sandbox is erased after 24 hours</strong></p>

<h3 id="extend-sunbird">Extend Sunbird</h3>

<p>If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you <a href="developer-docs/installation/installing_sunbirdon_laptop/" target="_blank">Install Sunbird on Laptop</a>. This allows you to get started quickly and help extend Sunbird.</p>

<h3 id="deploy-sunbird-for-up-to-10-thousand-users">Deploy Sunbird for up to 10 Thousand Users</h3>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird for up to 10 thousand users, we recommend you follow the <a href="developer-docs/installation/medium_scale_deploy/" target="_blank">Medium scale deployment</a> process. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.</p>

<h3 id="deploy-sunbird-for-over-10-thousand-users">Deploy Sunbird for over 10 Thousand Users</h3>

<p>If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with over 10 thousand users, we recommend you follow the <a href="" target="_blank">Large scale deployment</a> process. 
This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerized manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.</p>
