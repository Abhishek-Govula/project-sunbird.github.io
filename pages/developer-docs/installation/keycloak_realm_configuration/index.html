<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Getting started with keycloak is explained in the following [link] (http://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/getting_started/index.html), it has step-by-step process to run and up the keycloak server locally.
If you are new to Keycloak,get started from here and its good to run and up the server locally and play around with it and understand the system.Sunbird uses Keycloak as the identity and authentication provider.</p>

<h2 id="access-keycloak">Access Keycloak</h2>
<p>Once the sunbird services are set up, navigate to https://sunbird.example.com/auth/admin (Assuming youâ€™ve set up sunbird on sunbird.example.com) to access the Keycloak administration.</p>

<h2 id="setting-the-admin-password">Setting the Admin password</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Log into the docker container running keycloak by executing the following commands:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
# Find where the container is running
docker service ps keycloak1
# If you are running all services on single server no need to SSH
# If you are in a different server, SSH into node running keycloak
ssh <node-running-keycloak-container>
# Find the keycloak container ID
docker ps | grep keycloak
# Login to container
docker exec -uroot -it <container-ID> sh
&lt;/pre&gt;

- Change to the path to keycloak root directory (most likely `/opt/jboss/keycloak`)

- Execute the following script to set the administrator user name and password
<pre>
$ ./bin/add-user-keycloak.sh -u <admin> -p <yourpassword>
&lt;/pre&gt;
The script will execute and creates admin user and password. 
- You can now log into the administration console using these credentials.

Once you view the administration console,clients and the secrets can be set by following steps.

## Import Realm

To simplify the configuration, Sunbird provides a ready to use realm that can be readily imported and used. Download the realm from [here] (pages/developer-docs/installation/other_files/keycloak-realm.json){:target="_blank"}. To import the realm, use the 'Add realm' button, refer to the following images to get more clarity. On the import screen, choose the json file and then click 'Create'.

      </a>

<a target="_blank" href="pages/developer-docs/installation/images/keycloak-choose-json.png">
        <img src="pages/developer-docs/installation/images/keycloak-choose-json.png" alt="choose keycloak json" class="plugin center" width="50%" />
      </a>

<a target="_blank" href="pages/developer-docs/installation/images/keycloak-import-realm.png">
        <img src="pages/developer-docs/installation/images/keycloak-import-realm.png" alt="Keycloak import realm" class="plugin center" width="50%" />
      </a>

Once the realm is imported ensure the realm is chosen as the active realm before proceeding with the rest of the configuration

##  SMTP Configuration

Email configuration is needed to ensure password reset and user management flows work smoothly. Navigate to `Realm Settings &gt; Email`. Fill up the SMTP credentials and use the Test Connection button to verify the SMTP connection is working.

## Create a user who can access the user management API

Navigate to Manage &gt; Users and create a new user. Put the username as `user-manager`, set the email to be verified and save. After saving, assign a password to this user.

Next, update the Client roles under Role mappings to ensure that this user has the `manage-users`, `query-users`, `query-groups` and `view-users` roles. The screenshot below has reference configuration.

<a target="_blank" href="pages/developer-docs/installation/images/keycloak-add-user-manager.png">
        <img src="pages/developer-docs/installation/images/keycloak-add-user-manager.png" alt="Keycloak use management" class="plugin center" width="50%" />
      </a>

Use these username and password values for this user as the values for `sunbird_sso_username` and `sunbird_sso_password` in the configuration.

## Update Client &amp; Secrets

Navigate to `Clients` and make the changes listed below to each of the clients. Only change the clients listed below. Settings for other clients need not be changed.
