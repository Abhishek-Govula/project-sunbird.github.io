## Overview 
This page guides you through the process of planning and executing Sunbird Database upgrades. In addition, this page provides information about various upgrade scenarios,such as initialization parameter changes, pros and cons.

## Introduction

The process of upgrading you cassandra installation is as follows:
  
  1. Build Process
  2. Deployment Process
  3. Commisioning Scenarios 
  4. Necessary instructions 
  5. Running the Script

## Build

* Create a `Cassandra_Build` Jenkins job. 
* Move to `sunbird-utils/cassandra-migration` directory and run `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

Artifact `cassandra-migration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` is created inside `sunbird-utils/cassandra-migration/target` directory.

## Deployment

* Create a `Cassandra_Deploy` Jenkins job. 
* Copy the artifact `cassandra-migration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`  from  `Cassandra_Build` to `Cassandra_Deploy`     
  Jenkins job.
* Copy the jar file to the remotethe  Cassandra machine. 
* Set the following enivronment variables on the Cassandra host:

```
  a. sunbird_cassandra_host: (in case of multiple host provide the value comma separated) 
  b. sunbird_cassandra_port: 
  c. sunbird_cassandra_username: (Optional) 
  d. sunbird_cassandra_password: (optional) 
  e. sunbird_cassandra_keyspace: (for ex: sunbird)
```

Before you execute the following command ensure, Cassandra keyspace is already created.

<pre>

Run java -cp "cassandra-migration-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.contrastsecurity.cassandra.migration.utils.MigrationScriptEntryPoint` on the remote cassandra machine.

</pre>

## Commissioning Scenarios

1. For setting up Cassandra afresh 

* As cassandra upgradation is implemented in release-1.4 before following above steps.

Run the default `cassandra.cql` file, which will create schema and tables until release-1.3. 
Cassandra.cql might through some errors which can ignored(will be fixed in later releases). 

2. If you are running a release less than release-1.4 (For e.g.: upgrading from release-1.2 to release-1.4)

* Follow the similar steps as scenorio-1, restore all cassandra data if a new cassandra is provisioned.

3. If you are running a release greater than equal to release-1.4 

* Run cassandra migration only, no need to run `cassandra.cql` file. 

## action:

1) Setup the cassandra migration across sunbird and ntp. 
2) Create deploy scripts for the sunbird clients.
3) Convert the `cassandra.cql` script idempotent.
4) Create cassandra backup and restore scripts.


## script.

* Script location is : **resources/db/migration/cassandra**
* Script file should be in this format : **V{major_version_no}.{minor_version_no}_{filename}.cql**

**Pros:**

1. it will pick all the files whose format is **V{major_version_no}.{minor_version_no}_{filename}.cql** under **resources/db/migration/cassandra**  location and run it. it's easy to manage the migration

**Cons:**
1. if any one file fail then it won't run further unless we fixed the issues manually.
2. after fixing file ,we need to delete false entry under cassandra_migration_version table , this table will be auto generated by cassandra migration.

  ```javascript 
   Table structure ----
    version text PRIMARY KEY,
    checksum int,
    description text,
    execution_time int,
    installed_by text,
    installed_on timestamp,
    installed_rank int,
    script text,
    success boolean,
    type text,
    version_rank int
   ```

3.  it's supporting only following format
      V{major_version_no}.{minor_version_no}_{filename}.cql
    
    V1.0_cassandra.cql // correct file format

    V1.0.1_cassandra.cql // incorrect file format
