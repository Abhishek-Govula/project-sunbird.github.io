Sunbird platform allows signed on users on integrated systems to seamlessly navigate on the portal. By design, the system is loose-coupled, and achieve the seamless navigation by sharing trusted login status. This keeps the technical complexity for integrating systems simple and the systems do not need to change their own sign-on protocols. 

The philosophy is built around a premise of trust between Sunbird and integrated systems. When an authenticated user on integrated system navigates to Sunbird, the integrated system redirects the browser and sends the details of the user to the portal. This data is signed using a private key of the sender, to allow Sunbird to trust the incoming data and allow the user to sign in. This ensures that for integrating systems, the change is only how they redirect users to the portal, and not on their internal authentication implementation.

### Prerequisites 

Before beginning the tech integration, ensure the following:

* User is registered on Sunbird

* User’s public key is shared with Sunbird

* ‘iss’ is shared with user
