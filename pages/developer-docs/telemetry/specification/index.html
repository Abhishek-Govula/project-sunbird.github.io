 "ver": , // Required. Version of the event data structure, currently "3.0"
 "mid": , // Required. Unique message ID. Used for deduplication, replay and update indexes
 
 // Who did the event
 "actor": { // Required. Actor of the event.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>All events have the same structure with only difference in edata structures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All events have unique event codes i.e., (IDs).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All events are as per platform schema</p>
