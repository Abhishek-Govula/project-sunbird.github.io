This section details standard telemetry workflows for different access channels.

## Mobile App Standard Flow

<pre>
START(type: "app")
    ...| --> app events such as IMPRESSION, FEEDBACK, etc may happen
    START(type: "session")
        ...
        | --> IMPRESSION - For the pages that the user visits
        | --> INTERACT --> one of the content is clicked
            | --> START(type: "player") --> events generated by specific content
                ...|
                ...| --> in-content events such as ASSESS, INTERACT, IMPRESSION, LEVEL_SET etc.
                ...|
            | --> END(type: "player")
        | --> IMPRESSION - Returned back to mobile app for content player
        ...| --> app events such as IMPRESSION, INTERACT, etc. may happen
        | --> INTERACT --> one of the content is clicked
            | --> START(type: "player") --> events generated by specific content
                ...|
                ...| --> in-content events such as ASSESS, INTERACT, IMPRESSION, LEVEL_SET etc.
                ...|
            | --> END(type: "player")
        | --> IMPRESSION - Returned back to mobile app for content player
        ...| --> app events such as IMPRESSION, INTERACT, etc. may happen
    END(type: "session")
    ...| --> app events such as APP_UPDATE, FEEDBACK, etc may happen
END(type: "app")
</pre>

## Portal Standard Flow

<pre>
AUDIT (object: user) --> (Optional if a user is created for the first time)
START(type: "session") --> User session starts
    ...
    | --> IMPRESSION - For the pages that the user visits
    | --> INTERACT - For the interactions on the page
    // there is no explicit logout/timeout
</pre>

## Editor Standard Flow

<pre>
START (type: "session") - User logs in
    ...
    | --> IMPRESSION (Portal) - User visits content creation page (cdata session)
    | --> INTERACT (Portal) - User initiates content creation
    | --> AUDIT (Platform) - User creates a new content
    | --> START (type: "editor", mode: "content")
        ...
        | --> INTERACT (Editor) - In editor, user is loading the asset browser
        | --> SEARCH (Platform) - In AT, user is searching for assets (cdata session, search result id)
        | --> PLUGIN_LIFECYCLE (Editor) - User selects the asset for content (which search result was used)
        | --> PLUGIN_LIFECYCLE (Editor) - User removes the asset from content
        | --> INTERACT (Editor) - User clicks save in AT
        | --> ACCESS (Platform) - Platform save API is called
        | --> INTERACT (Editor) - User clicks on submit to review
        | --> AUDIT (object: Content, state: "Review", prevstate: "Draft") - Platform sends the content to review state
    | --> END (type: "editor", mode: "content") - User closes the editor and goes back to portal
    </pre>

## Back-end Services Standard Flow
    
    <pre> 
    AUDIT (object: Service, state: "Ready") --> State transition to READY
    ...| --> ACCESS events for API requests
    ACCESS
        LOG --> Log events in the context of the incoming request (by request correlation ID)
        ...
    METRICS --> Health/business metrics (e.g. number of jobs executed)
    AUDIT (object: Service, state: "Stopped") --> State transition to STOPPED
    </pre>

## Analytics Jobs Standard Flow

<pre>
JOB_START --> Data product job start
    ...
    | --> JOB_LOG - To log some data while Data product job is in progress
    ...
JOB_END --> Data product job end
</pre>

## Telemetry V3 Event Structure

All events follow a common data structure, though the event data structure (“edata”) differs for each event. The  complete data structure is as follows: 

<pre>
{
 // About the event
 "eid": , // Required. TODO: Shall we rename it to "verb" ?? 
 "ets": , // Required. Epoch timestamp of event (time in milli-seconds. For ex: 1442816723)
 "ver": , // Required. Version of the event data structure, currently "3.0"
 "mid": , // Required. Unique message ID. Used for deduplication, replay and update indexes
 
 // Who did the event
 "actor": { // Required. Actor of the event.
   "id": , // Required. Id of the actor. For ex: uid incase of an user
   "type":  // Required. User, System etc.
 },
 
 // Context of the event
 "context": { // Required. Context in which the event has occured.
   "channel": , // Required. Channel which has produced the event
   "pdata": { // Optional. Producer of the event
     "id": , // Required. unique id assigned to that component
     "pid": , // Optional. In case the component is distributed, then which instance of that component
     "ver":  // Optional. version number of the build
   },
   "env": , // Required. Unique environment where the event has occured.
   "sid": , // Optional. session id of the requestor stamped by portal
   "did": , // Optional. uuid of the device, created during app installation
   "cdata": [{ // Optional. correlation data
     "type":"", // Required. Used to indicate action that is being correlated
     "id": "" // Required. The correlation ID value
   }],
   "rollup": { // Optional. Context rollups
     "l1": "",
     "l2": "",
     "l3": "",
     "l4": ""
   }
 },
 // What is the target of the event
 "object": { // Optional. Object which is the subject of the event.
   "id": , // Required. Id of the object. For ex: content id incase of content
   "type": , // Required. Type of the object. For ex: "Content", "Community", "User" etc.
   "ver": , // Optional. version of the object
   "rollup": { // Optional. Rollups to be computed of the object. Only 4 levels are allowed.
   	"l1": "",
     "l2": "",
     "l3": "",
     "l4": ""
   }
 },
 
 // What is the event data
 "edata": {} // Required.
 
 // Tags
 "tags": [] // Optional. Encrypted dimension tags passed by respective channels
}
</pre>

**Note:**

* All events have the same structure with only difference in edata structures.

* All events have unique event codes i.e., (IDs).

* All events are as per platform schema
