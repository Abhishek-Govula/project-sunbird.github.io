<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

<p>A company, XYZ Corp, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 5 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. To ensure that employees are regularly trained and upskilled, XYZ Corp has decided to use Sunbird for its learning and training solution. To give employees access to the learning platform, the organizationâ€™s administrator needs to create and add user details.</p>

<p>Every user belongs to an organization and is identified within the organization through a unique user ID. Sunbird, uniquely identifies every tenant organization through a channel. Hence, when creating a user, its not enough to only add user details and assign a user ID. To enable users, the user ID has to be associated with an organization and channel. Since a user also plays a role within an organization, the user gets fully enabled only after the user ID is associated to a role. For example, John is a manager in XYZ corporation, who can create, review and take courses. He is also an administrator in the system, in which capacity he can add users and assign permissions to them.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>1.An initialized server instance of Sunbird. Initialization includes creating an org admin user (through Keycloak), creating a channel and associating a first organization with the channel.</p>
