<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

<p>Sunbird enables seamless access and discoverability of content through a <a href="http://www.sunbird.org/faqs/taxonomymetadataframework/">taxonomy framework</a>. The objective and intent of the framework is to ensure that content creators have an easy interface to tag content appropriately such that when a user search for content, they get relevant results. The framework consists of categories and terms within a specific domain. Terms are values for Categories. You can extend the core taxonomy via framework. The separation of the taxonomy from its extension in the form of framework(s) provides experts and pedagogues the power and flexibility to model and tag the content.</p>

<p>An organization can use existing framework term and concepts and link them to their own framework. While creating a new framework, the framework creator needs to set up a new framework and align it to the categories and terms. A category can have terms either in sequential list or in hierarchical structure. Terms can be associated with other terms across categories. As a result, it is possible to select a term in the first category and hence restrict the set of available terms for the next category and so on. The organizations that are adopting Sunbird can link the categories and also change the labels but cannot override or add a new categories on their own. However, the Sunbird instance will have the following categories in its predefined frameworks:</p>

<pre><code>- Subject: classification of stream specific values
- Board: certifying body/stream government or private organization
- Grade Level: maturity level for knowledge  
- Medium: language of the course 
- Topic: detail of the concepts 
</code></pre>

<p>A user can select one or more category amongst the defined category. Let us consider an example of an organization, Neerdhara, which works in the domain of water conservation and works with multiple NGOs, village panchayats, and district administration authorities in multiple states of India. They now need to create the framework for water management.  The organization may choose a predefined category and associate it to their own framework. The categories in the framework has terms associated with it. These terms are relevant to the created framework and can be created by the organization.</p>

<p>For example, for the organization Neerdhara the framework name is Neerdhara and code as ndf1; the category selected is subject and change the label as Resource type which defines the various water resources and contains the terms as Rain water, lake, ponds and so on.</p>
