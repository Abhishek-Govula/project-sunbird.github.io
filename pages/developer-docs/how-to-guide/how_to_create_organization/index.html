<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

<p>A company, XYZ Corp, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 5 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. To ensure that employees are regularly trained and upskilled, XYZ Corp has decided to use Sunbird for its learning and training solution. To give employees access to the learning platform, the organizationâ€™s administrator needs to create an organization.</p>

<p>Sunbird identifies every tenant organization uniquely through a channel. When creating an organization, in addition, to organization details, Organization ID must be assigned. The organization ID has to be associated with an organization and a channel. For example, John is a manager in XYZ corporation, who can create, review and take courses. He is also an administrator in the system, in which capacity he can add users and assign permissions to them.</p>
