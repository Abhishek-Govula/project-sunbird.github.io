<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>

<p>A company, XYZ Corp, is a global conglomerate with over ten thousand employees, spread across 5 locations. Employee training and enablement is one of the core values of the organization. To ensure that employees are regularly trained and upskilled, XYZ Corp has decided to use Sunbird for its learning and training solution. To give employees access to the learning platform, the organizationâ€™s administrator needs to create and add user details with the organization.</p>

<p>Every user must belong to an organization and is identified within the organization through a unique user ID. To enable users, the user ID has to be associated with an organization and channel and subsequently assigned a role. For example, John is a manager in XYZ corporation, who can create, review and take courses. He is also an administrator in the system, in which capacity he can add users and assign permissions to them and associate them with the organization.</p>
