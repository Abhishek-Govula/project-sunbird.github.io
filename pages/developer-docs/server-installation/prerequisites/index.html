<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>To install Sunbird you require system admninisrtation rights and must have hands on experience with Linux systems administration and Docker for running containerized services.</p>

<p>Sunbird has been tested on cloud hosted Linux servers (Azure &amp; AWS). Sunbird will not function correctly if deployed on virtual machines or in-premise infrastructure, like rack mounted servers or blades. Sunbird has not been tested on any Microsoft® operating systems</p>

<p>This section explains the minimum prerequisites that must be ensured before installing Sunbird on your server</p>

<h2 id="api-key">API Key</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sunbird requires EkStep API keys to access the EkStep content repository. For details on how to get access the keys, refer <a href="http://www.sunbird.org/developer-docs/server_installation/ekstep_keys" target="_blank">Ekstep API Keys</a> to get the keys. If you are creating a test environment, get the QA API keys</li>
  <li>Use the key and secret to generate JWT.  Use the web based tool - http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com/. Note that when using this tool, the key in the EkStep Developer credentials should be set as the Issuer field and the secret in the Key field</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="domain-name">Domain Name</h2>

<ul>
  <li>It is recommended that you have a registered domain name</li>
  <li>If you do not have a domain name, you can configure Sunbird such that it can be accessed over an IP address</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ssl-certificate">SSL Certificate</h2>
